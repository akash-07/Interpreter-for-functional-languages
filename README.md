## Overview

#### The Interpreter for Haskell would be built in four steps. 
- The first step includes understanding syntax and sematics of haskell and knowing how it's different constructs would be handled by the     Interpreter.
- Secondly, we would be designing a pretty printer to make the output readable and elegant.
- Thirdly, the Lexer would be made which would convert the input Program String into a list of Tokens.
- Fourthly, this list of tokens would be parsed to convert it into a format accepted by the Machine or as defined in the Interpreter.
- Lastly, the parsed tokens would then be evaluated by a graph reducer based on template instantiation.
